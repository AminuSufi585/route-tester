# Route Tester

Test React Router v4's `<Route>` component to verify what locations it will match. A `path` is parsed using [`path-to-regexp`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp). The `strict` prop is the same as it is in `path-to-regexp`. The `exact` prop in React Router is the `end` option in `path-to-regexp`.
